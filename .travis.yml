# Travis config is driven by the tox.ini file.

# Here we just specify:
# 1. The Python versions to run - it will start a CI server for each, and run all the tox environments
#    that use that Python. So in Travis we are running both in parallel (one server per Python version)
#    and in series (each server runs all the Django envs for that version of Python).
# 2. For *one* python version, we add an extra run of the unit tests - with coverage. The results are then fed to
#    coveralls.
